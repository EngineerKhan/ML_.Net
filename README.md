ML_.Net is a project aimed at converting the Machine Learning Algorithms to .Net 
(There have already been plenty of them available in .Net but majority are basic and need optimization as well).

Main purpose of the project is to approach the algorithms from Software Engineering perspective, so they can be deployed 
in applications (web applications as well).

Looking forward to see contributions of all of you.
